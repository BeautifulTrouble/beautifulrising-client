Some, like a sit-in, march or picket line, have been used for generations. Others, like flash mobs and hashtag campaigns, are recent innovations. As with ballet or boxing, a single tactic, no matter how well executed, rarely wins the day. Victory comes, if it comes, through creative combination and variation.'
