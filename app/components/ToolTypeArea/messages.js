    defaultMessage: 'Revolutionaries practice without safety nets. Our laboratory is the world around us – the streets, the Internet, the airwaves, our own hearts. We experiment, we fail, we readjust, we try again, maybe this time a little less disastrously, a little more beautifully – until eventually, we win. Always we learn. In these stories we share what we’ve learned.'

    id: 'app.components.ToolTypeArea.tacticsLong',
    defaultMessage: 'Every discipline has its forms of action: ballet dancers lunge and pirouette; boxers throw jabs and uppercuts. Likewise, creative activists have their own forms of action. Some, like a sit-in, march or picket line, have been used for generations. Others, like flash mobs and hashtag campaigns, are recent innovations. As with ballet or boxing, a single tactic, no matter how well executed, rarely wins the day. Victory comes, if it comes, through creative combination and variation.'

These hard-won insights are not strict rules, but rather loose guidelines to keep in mind as you design your own actions.'

Look no further.'

That’s where these exercises and strategic frameworks come in: they are tools to help you better understand your situation, plan your next steps, assess your progress, and, eventually, win.'
